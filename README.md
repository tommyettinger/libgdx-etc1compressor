# libgdx-etc1compressor
A standalone version of gdx-tools' ETC1Compressor.

See the Releases section for runnable JARs.

This should be on Maven Central now; you can depend on it with Gradle:

```
api "com.github.tommyettinger:libgdx-etc1compressor:1.11.0.0"
```

or if you use Maven (unlikely unless you know you need it):

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.tommyettinger</groupId>
  <artifactId>libgdx-etc1compressor</artifactId>
  <version>1.11.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

[See the libGDX wiki for more information](https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/2d/texture-compression).

This was taken from inside [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and moved so it can be run more easily from
outside that framework. It still has the same license as libGDX.
